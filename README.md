# MSc-Data-Visualisation-Project
This repository houses a Tableau dashboard which was created for the purposes of aiding key decision makers within a retail organisation.
The aim of this task was to use data analysis techniques to create insight for key stakeholders within a retail organisation for the purposes of enabling profit maximisation, performance measurement and optimal budgeting. The analysis was successfully used to identify key regions and customers for targeted marketing campaigns, identify optimal sales levels and track sales performance against pre-specified targets. The analysis also made use of key trends i.e., sales volume vs profit to identify areas of diminishing returns. The information was summarized on a fully interactive Tableau dashboard and allowed for further development to include key AI techniques such as clustering, similar to those used at Amazon and Facebook, to create further insight and value.
